# The-3rd-YouTube-8M-Video-Understanding-Challenge
## Sprint 1

### Product Definition

#### Product Mission
For researchers, college students and ordinary youtube users who want to retrieve a specific moment, such as a scene, an object or an action from youtube videos, this product can identify whether a youtube video may satisfy their requests. If the video contains the specific moments the users required, it can output the time when the moments happen in the video. 

#### Target User(s)
  1. Researchers
  2. College students
  3. Ordinary youtube users

#### User Stories
1. I, the researcher, should be able to get a result with at least 70% accuracy from this model.
2. I, the researcher, should be able to receive the source code of this model so that I can improve it.
3. I, the general public, should be able to know the duration of the moments I want in the video.


#### MVP
The minimum product should satisfy the following requirements:
  1. the module can perform object detection with a specific accuracy
  2. the module can store the searching result for users.
  
#### User Interface Design for main user story if required

Users are allowed to pick up a label to search for.

### Product Survey

#### Existing similar products
 The YOLO detection system: 
      It's easy to process images, it runs a convolutional network on the image and thresholds the resulting detections by         the module's confidence.
      It can predict what objects are present and where they are.
      Benefits: extremely fast, high precision, reasons globally about the image when making predictions.
